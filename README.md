Welcome to my `styles.csv` project for Stable Diffusion! This is a personal initiative where I curate and maintain a comprehensive list of styles to enhance your creative workflows. The file is currently in work in progress, and I am continuously updating it to ensure it remains relevant and useful. Stay tuned for future improvements and additions as I refine this resource over time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!
This file is specifically designed for Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5). I am not responsible for any issues or incompatibilities that may arise when using it with other Stable Diffusion models.

PS: I was tired of relying on styles.csv files created by others. While they worked to some extent, I wanted something tailored to my own preferences and creative vision. This project is my attempt to build a resource that truly reflects my needs and artistic goals.

## üöÄ Installation and Usage
